    <P> For most of my life I have beeen obsessed with video games, they are all I think about every day. Therefore I am going into
        video game design. My hope is that one day I will have a gaming studio that will rivel some of the bigger name game studios
        such as Naughty Dog and From Software.   </P>

    <P> Originaly my major was in business managment buts as I finished all of my prerequisite for that major I relized that I had a 
        lot of trouble just trying to keep up. So like most people who swicth their major two years into school I panicked thinking 
        I wasted my time and my parents money. Luckly I meet up with a career counseler and she helped me realise that making video
        games is something that I could acutally do so thats wat I did and I never looked back. </P>

    <P>Although I am almost finished with school I still consider myself a novice with game design. Though I can do the work and I 
        have, I still feel behind as I see some of the other amazing works other students make and I won't lie seeingthat makes 
        it difficult to feel like this is something I can do. But I still hav to give myself some credit other students have been 
        working on visual studio code and unity for years while I obly have been using these programs for only two years. With this major,
        I believe that practice makes perfect and the more I work on what Im passionite about the better I will become. 

    </P>
